# This is the API creation exercise
## I used 3 NPM modules to create it

- ### express.js 
  - #### For the route handling
- ### mongoose
  - #### For the data modeling in MongoDB
- ### node-fetch
  - #### To get the JSON object in the given txt
  
## I connected it to a MongoDB cluster in the cloud for the API to be executed in every computer
